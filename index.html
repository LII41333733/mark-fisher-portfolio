        <h2 class="mb-4">Interests</h2>
        <p>Apart from my love for being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time around music, both listening and playing. Trumpet is my main musical instrument and I have been playing for over 15 years now. For many of my playing years, I have been a part of  several World Class Drum and Bugle Corps. including the <strong class="school-name">Holy Name Cadets (Allentown, PA)</strong> and the <strong class="school-name">Boston Crusaders (Boston, MA)</strong>, both in the <em>Drum Corps International</em> circuit. I most recently served as Brass Captain for the <strong class="school-name">Hawthorne Caballeros Drum and Bugle Corps. (Hawthorne, NJ)</strong> for the 2016 and 2017 seasons.</p>
        <p>Off the field, I love staying active between weightlifting and being an outdoorsman. You will find me either camping, kayaking, hiking or playing any kind of sports I can involve myself in. Even though I am a die-hard <strong class="eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</strong> fan and wear my fandom on my sleeve, I am a fanatic of all sports and enjoy going to live events any chance I can.</p>

            <p class="port-text-para mt-2 text-center">Rate My Plate is a review app that is not tailored to critique of the restaurant as a whole, but of their items specifically. Sure, Yelp and Google Reviews are the go-to spot for restaurant reviews, but they tend to be too objective and less focused on the actual items themselves. Patrons may give their opinion on a dish, but unless you go digging through a bunch of reviews and comments to find the particular opinion you are looking for, how would you ever know that there is a restaurant nearby that has an awesome Shrimp Tempura Roll or a delectable Cosmo that is to absolutely die for?</p>
